- plugin system
	- somehow get Renderer_D3d12 typename
	- but it needs to fill it out using reflection?
	- we can have a proc in the plugin -- but that's just boiler plate
	- can api.odin have lazy loading procedure in it, that calls a proc in base?

- introduce a separate rendering thread
	- we could do a job based system where command lists are created as jobs and then submitted
	- needs a renderer interface


- UI:
	- package?
