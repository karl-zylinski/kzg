- dynamic mapping to things in shader
	- use shader reflection: https://rtarun9.github.io/blogs/shader_reflection/
	- create a table so we can bind it
	- for cbuffers and structuredbuffer

- map UI resources in a pretty way

- introduce a separate rendering thread
	- we could do a job based system where command lists are created as jobs and then submitted
	- needs a renderer interface

- plugin system
	- Hot reloadable DLLs with API struct

- UI:
	- package?
