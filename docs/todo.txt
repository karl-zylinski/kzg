- plugin system
	- @(api="Name") -- put in `struct Name {}` in API file
	- @(api_type) -- copy of the struct in api file
	- @(api_type_opaque) -- empty struct in api file
	- parse file, find things tagged with these attributes
	- generate api file, with an exported proc that creates the API

- introduce a separate rendering thread
	- we could do a job based system where command lists are created as jobs and then submitted
	- needs a renderer interface


- UI:
	- package?
