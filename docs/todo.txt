- plugin system
	- Move types from `api_types.odin` to normal files and make them use some @api attribute. Make the whole type print into the API file
	- Rename `api_types.odin` to `api_imports.odin`... I think?
	- Try reloading a plugin when the DLL changes on disk.
		- Maybe we can reload the DLL that uses it too if the API struct changes (since the API struct becomes part of the import)

- introduce a separate rendering thread
	- we could do a job based system where command lists are created as jobs and then submitted
	- needs a renderer interface


- UI:
	- package?
